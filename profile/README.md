### `BookBite`

A simple dining companion that brings the ability to **reserve tables** & **order food** to **dine-in**, and even a simple **takeaway**. All in one app!
Listing trustworthy restaurant profiles, category‑based menus, and clear details about menu items so decisions are fast and confident. Easy filtering options allow you to zone in on *your* perfect meal within minutes.

We've all been there, driving across the city only to find your favorite restaurant packed, or waiting 30 minutes for food that could've been ready when you arrived. BookBite eliminates these everyday frustrations by bringing convenience to your fingertips.

### How it works

+  Pick a restaurant, browse categories, and add items to cart.
    
+  View past orders with the option to “Order Again” for instant re‑ordering.
    
+  For dine-in, reserve tables for you and your guests.
    
+  Set an ETA; the kitchen times prep to be ready on arrival.
    
+  Arrive, sit at the reserved table or simply pick up your meal, with minimal waiting.
    
+  Get refunded for a cancelled reservation.
    
+  And it checks with the chefs if a meal is possible, before you pay for it.
